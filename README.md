# Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website built from scratch to showcase my academic work, technical skills, and projects as a Computer Science student at UTEP pursuing a fast-track BS/MS program focused on AI.

## Purpose

This portfolio serves as both a learning project and a professional showcase. I'm building it to understand web development fundamentals deeply before moving to frameworks, while creating a platform to share my journey and work with potential employers and collaborators.

## Technologies

### Current Stack
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup for accessibility and maintainability
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with flexbox layouts, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Vanilla JS for interactive features (no frameworks)

### Design Features
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- CSS animations and scroll-triggered effects
- Sticky navigation with backdrop filter
- Timeline components for educational background
- Clean, minimal aesthetic with thoughtful use of shadows and spacing

### Future Stack (Planned)
- **Node.js & Express.js** - Backend server and API
- **Nginx** - Reverse proxy and web server
- **Home Lab Deployment** - Self-hosted on personal server
- **Let's Encrypt** - SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
